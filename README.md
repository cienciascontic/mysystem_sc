-----------------

### MySystem. A system diagraming tool. ###

![what we are working on](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/73403/mysystem_sc/mysystem_sc.png "feature being worked on")

-----------------

### Getting started: ###

1. git clone git://github.com/concord-consortium/mysystem_sc.git mysystem_sc
2. cd mysystem_sc
3. git submodule update --init
4. echo 'rvm use 1.9.2@my_system_sc --create' > .rvmrc; cd ..; cd -
5. bundle install --binstubs
6. bin/sc-server
7. if you get an error about 'iconv' see this [rvm page](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/packages/iconv/)

### Run tests in browser ###
For Jasmine:

1. start sc server: bin/sc-server
2. open jasmine test page in browser: http://localhost:4020/my_system/en/current/tests/jasmine.html

For Qunit:

1. start sc server: bin/sc-server
2. open qunit test page in browser: http://localhost:4020/my_system/en/current/tests/qunit.html

The tests are located at: mysystem_sc/apps/mysystem/tests

If you want to run a subset of the tests you can update the url above to include the folder name.  For example:
http://localhost:4020/my_system/en/current/tests/qunit/views.html

### Initial student data

The app saves the "student data" state (i.e., the nodes, links, and stories) into a div with id my_system_state, which is defined in apps/my_system/lib/index.rhtml. To update the default initial student state, serialize the dataHash property of the studentStateDataSource, escape the serialized JSON it for inclusion in an html document, and put it inside the my_system_state div in that element.

### Lebowski testing: ###

0. the Gemfile stipulates dependencies on lebowski
1. cd to your sproutcore directory: <code> cd /path/to/mysystem_sc </code>
2. run the test! <code>bundle exec lebowski-spec spec/mysystem_spec.rb</code> (where mysystem_spec.rb is your test)

### Cucumber testing: ###

0. the Gemfile stipulates dependencies on lebowski
1. cd to your sproutcore directory: <code> cd /path/to/mysystem_sc </code>
2. run the tests! <code>bundle exec cucumber features/</code>

### Running SproutCore QUnit tests with capybara-testrunner ###
From the top-level mysystem_sc directory:
1. make sure the gems are installed:
`bundle install --binstubs`

2. remove cached files:
`rm -rf tmp`

3. remove old reports
`rm reports/*.xml`

4. `$SC_SERVER_PORT` is usually 4020. That environment variable is used so multiple ci server (such as Husdon) job instances don't use the same port
`export SC_SERVER_PORT=4020`

5. Run the tests
`bundle exec ruby run-unit-tests.rb -i -o reports`

### Running in Wise4 using vagrant ###

0. Install prerequisites: git, vagrant, and virtualbox
1. Clone this git repository https://github.com/concord-consortium/wise4-vagrant
2. In the mysystem_sc folder, build the Wise4 step: 
2a. bundle exec rake build
2b. bundle exec rake copy_authoring
3. In the wise4-vagrant folder, create the file wise4-step-types.yml listing the name of the step and path to the build output:
    --- 
    Mysystem2: ../mysystem_sc/vle/node/mysystem2
4. Run vagrant up in the wise4-vagrant folder, or if you already started vagrant, run vagrant reload
5. open a web browser to http://localhost:8080/webapp/index.html
6. login as admin:pass
7. NEED HELP fininishing these steps, this page has more instuctions on getting started
     http://code.google.com/p/wise4/wiki/WISE4AdministratorResources
   But we need to customize that for mysystem2.

### Building as WISE4 step ###


0. Install WISE4. See [the docs](http://code.google.com/p/wise4/wiki/StableWISEDeploymentModel) for the gory details. [Check with the wise4-dev google group  ]( http://groups.google.com/group/wise4-dev ) if you run into problems.
1. Make sure $CATALINA_HOME is points to the directory where Tomcat is installed.
2. run the default rake task: `bundle exec rake` (This will invoke sc-build and rezsquish from http://github.com/knowuh/resource_squasher to create a WISE4 compatible mysystem_sc "node" in folder vle/node/mysystem_sc)
3. run the 'copy_files' rake task: `bundle exec rake copy_files`. This will copy the MySystem files to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/vlewrapper/vle/node/mysystem_sc/
4. Startup the WISE4 server: `cd $CATALINA_HOME; bin/startup.sh`
5. Verify that you can visit the MySystem app directly: http://localhost:8080/vlewrapper/vle/node/mysystem_sc/mysystem_sc.html
6. Login at [http://localhost:8080/webapp/](http://localhost:8080/webapp/) as a teacher and create a project with MySystem as an active step. Then create a 'project run' based on that project and remember the signup code.
7. Login to http://localhost:8080/webapp/ as a student and enter the signup code you saved. Click on "Run Project" to run the project that includes the MySystem step. Manipulate the MySystem system diagram and leave the step by signing off or switching to another step (if you created one.) Close the browser page and login again to verify that your manipulation was persisted to WISE4.

The files put into $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/vlewrapper/vle/node/mysystem_sc are derived from the files in this repository in the folders wise4/mysystem_sc and apps/my_system/lib/index.rhtml via the default Rake task. See the Rakefile in the root of this repo. These template files created in accordance with the directions at http://code.google.com/p/wise4/wiki/HowToCreateANewWise4Step as of 5/2/2011

### Notes from Hiroki ### 
* look at open response step for example of saving outside of window save
   open_response.js
* add in energy_type for the link

? Initial state of diagram for student???

* have check button trigger Mysystem.save()
* save the text of the computed
* teacher classroom monitoring tool
-- look at cargraph studentstatus and StudentAlertable
* car graph step does some "aggregation" report, it has a slider for filtering which student results to show.
